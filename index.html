<!-- todo list:
draw line connecting tiles
check if any connections are still possible, if not -> shuffle
Maybe try to make the number of images more even
Make it so that if you have one image selected and you select another one that doesn't match - select that image instead.
Timer + increase time when matching tiles
Menu
Victory condition
add background image -->

<!-- Image selection notes:
level 1 has about 20 images
level 3 has more, about 25 or 30?
what you can do is put ALL images of a class inside a folder, then select n (for example 20) random images
from that folder and generate those, that way it adds more variety -->
